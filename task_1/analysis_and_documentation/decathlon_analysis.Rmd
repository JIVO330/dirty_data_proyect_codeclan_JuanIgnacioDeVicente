```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
A brief introduction to the dataset
A list of any assumptions you have made
The steps you took to clean the data (you donâ€™t need to write out in detail every step, but a combination of commented code chunks with surrounding overall explanations would be great).
The answers to the questions presented in the task brief
Any other interesting analyses or conclusions you come across.

**#Introduction

**#Assumptions

My first assumption is very simple, it is very sure I will have mistakes and errors so do simple things because I will waste a lot of time.
I avoid to do assumptions, when I read the task's title I thought about the Decathlon's shops.
