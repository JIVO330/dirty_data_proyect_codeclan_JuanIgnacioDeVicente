A brief introduction to the data set
A list of any assumptions you have made
The steps you took to clean the data (you donâ€™t need to write out in detail every step, but a combination of commented code chunks with surrounding overall explanations would be great).
The answers to the questions presented in the task brief
Any other interesting analyses or conclusions you come across.

**#Introduction
This data set  is the combination of two the results of two competitions  where the athletes had participated, although it is unknown the years one represents an Olympic games and the other is a french competition called Decastar. However not all the athletes in the table had participated in both competitions.

**#Assumptions

My first assumption is very simple, it is very sure I will have mistakes and errors so do simple things because I will waste a lot of time.
I avoid to do assumptions, when I read the task's title I thought about the Decathlon's shops.
